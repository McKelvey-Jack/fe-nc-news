Hi and welome to the frontend repo of my nc-news project.

To run this project locally on your machine you can clone the repo and use either Npm instal or Yarn install to install the dependencies, then you should be ready to rock!

The project is built with react and the data held is a postgresSQL database. I have used axios to comunicate to my backend server which is a rest API built with node and express.
